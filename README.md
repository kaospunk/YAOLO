# YAOLO
YAOLO (Yet Another Offensive LinkedIn Obtainer)

Python script which will enumerate employee information given either a company or company id's. A keyword can also be provided to search for within employee's titles. Output is written as a comma separated value with the following format:
Member Id, First Name, Last Name, Title(Occupation), Profile URL

You must always provide a user account which will be used to perform the search from. Upon running the script you must provide the account's password.

You must provide *either* a company name or a list of company id's which can be identified from LinkedIn's site.

You may optionally provide a keyword to search within the title/occupation field.

No real error checking at this time...
